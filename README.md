# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

This repository contains projects completed as part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program offered by Udacity in collaboration with AWS. The nanodegree focuses on developing foundational AI programming skills using Python and explores various aspects of machine learning and deep learning.

## Projects

### 1. Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

#### Overview
In this project, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to build an image classifier capable of recognizing different dog breeds. The classifier is trained on a dataset that includes human and dog images, and it can predict the breed of a dog given an image.

#### Instructions
1. Run `check_images.py` script in the CLI and specifiy input arguments.
2. The script will use a pretrained torchvision model for classification and print results.

### 2. Create Your Own Image Classifier

#### Overview
This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model using PyTorch for classifying flowers into multiple classes. The dataset used for training and validation contains images of flowers belonging to different species.

#### Instructions
1. The detailed workflow is described in `Image Classifier Project.html` or the Jupyter notebook version of it.
2. Use `train.py` to train the model on your own dataset on the CLI and save it as checkpoint `.pth`.
3. Use `predict.py` to load specified checkpoint `.pth` file to predict a given image in CLI.
